`YAO` stands for `Yielding AI Outcomes` — the goal is not to generate more prompt text, but to produce reusable AI assets and real operational outcomes.

`yao-meta-skill` creates, evaluates, packages, and governs reusable agent skills. The 1.0 line focused on turning repeated workflows into installable, readable, cross-platform skill packages. The 2.0 line expands that factory into a Skill OS: a governed system for modeling a skill once, compiling it for multiple targets, testing its behavior, reviewing its release evidence, and tracking the next iteration.

[Quick Start](#quick-start) · [Skill OS 2.0](#skill-os-20-upgrade) · [1.0 vs 2.0](#from-10-to-20) · [Operator UX](#operator-ux-commands) · [Benchmark](#weighted-quality-benchmark) · [Examples](examples/README.md) · [Evals](evals/README.md) · [Failure Library](failures/README.md) · [Method Doctrine](#method-doctrine)

## Skill OS 2.0 Upgrade

Skill OS 2.0 keeps the original promise of `yao-meta-skill`, but makes the package lifecycle more explicit. Instead of stopping at `SKILL.md`, it adds a semantic contract, target compilers, evaluation evidence, release gates, and operation reports around the skill.

- **Skill IR**: a platform-neutral intermediate representation for intent, triggers, inputs, outputs, boundaries, references, and expected artifacts.
- **Target compilers and adapters**: generated surfaces for OpenAI, Claude, generic agent skills, Agent Skills compatible packages, and VS Code-oriented workflows.
- **Output Eval Lab**: trigger checks, output assertions, execution evidence, timing and token evidence, benchmark reproducibility, blind-review packs, answer keys, and adjudication reports.
- **Review Studio 2.0**: a single HTML gate page for intent, triggers, output eval, context cost, runtime checks, trust, Skill Atlas signals, adoption drift, waivers, annotations, release evidence, warnings, blockers, and fix actions.
- **Evidence and release governance**: evidence consistency checks, package verification, install simulation, runtime permission probes, world-class evidence intake, world-class ledger, operator runbook, and public claim guard.
- **SkillOps loop**: metadata-only adoption drift, telemetry hooks, adaptive proposals, daily and weekly curator reports, and portfolio-level drift signals.

Current posture: the repository is ready for beta and external testing, while stronger public "world-class" claims remain evidence-gated. Provider-backed production evidence, human blind-review evidence, native permission execution, and real-client telemetry are tracked as separate evidence tasks instead of being treated as completed work.

## From 1.0 to 2.0

| Dimension | 1.0 focus | 2.0 upgrade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product role | Create, refactor, evaluate, and package reusable skills. | Govern the full lifecycle of a skill: creation, compilation, evaluation, review, release, telemetry, and iteration. |
| Architecture | `SKILL.md`, `agents/interface.yaml`, manifest files, and report artifacts. | Skill IR, target compilers, adapters, gate contracts, evidence ledgers, release locks, and action-oriented review pages. |
| Cross-platform delivery | OpenAI, Claude, and generic package targets. | Adds broader Agent Skills and VS Code-oriented compatibility, with registry-readable compatibility records. |
| Quality model | Trigger and structure checks plus report-based review. | Output eval, benchmark reproducibility, execution evidence, failure disclosure, blind-review packs, and evidence consistency checks. |
| Report experience | Overview HTML and first-pass review pages. | Bilingual Skill Overview v2, Review Studio 2.0, reviewer annotations, action cards, charts, and audit-oriented report contracts. |
| Release boundary | Package output with basic validation. | Package verification, install simulation, runtime permission probes, release locks, public claim guard, and operator runbooks. |
| Operating loop | Manual feedback and local iteration. | Adoption drift, metadata telemetry, SkillOps reports, adaptive proposals, and portfolio-level drift detection. |

## 2.0 Use Cases

- **Create a new skill from repeated work**: start with a workflow note, prompt set, transcript, runbook, or document pattern, then generate a package with a lean entrypoint, explicit inputs and outputs, references, reports, and the lightest justified gates.
- **Upgrade a personal skill into a team asset**: add interface contracts, manifests, target adapters, trust checks, output evals, reviewer waivers, release notes, and Review Studio evidence before other people depend on the skill.
- **Prepare a skill for beta release**: run package verification, install simulation, compatibility checks, runtime permission probes, and evidence consistency checks, then separate beta readiness from stronger public claims.
- **Keep a skill useful after release**: use metadata-only telemetry, adoption drift, feedback logs, SkillOps reports, and adaptive proposals to decide whether the next move should be documentation, an eval, a skill patch, or a governance update.
- **Compare with other meta-skill approaches**: keep Anthropic/OpenAI-style conversational creation and lean instruction writing where they fit, then use `yao-meta-skill` when the package needs evidence, portability, release gates, and repeatable maintenance.

## Operator UX Commands

These read-only helper commands turn common maintainer questions into repeatable diagnostics:

```bash
python3 scripts/yao.py install-status --expected-source .
python3 scripts/yao.py localized-doc-sync-check
python3 scripts/yao.py pr-review-report 4 --repo yaojingang/yao-meta-skill
```

- `install-status` explains whether the active skill is coming from `.codex/skills`, `.agents/skills`, or the disabled mirror, and flags duplicate active installs.
- `localized-doc-sync-check` verifies that the Chinese README carries the public homepage sections that were added to the English README.
- `pr-review-report` reads GitHub PR metadata, changed files, status checks, and suggested local commands without merging or mutating the PR.

## Capability Surface

It turns rough workflows, transcripts, prompts, notes, and runbooks into reusable skill packages with:

- a clear trigger surface
- a lean `SKILL.md`
- optional references, scripts, and evals
- a front-loaded intent dialogue with an intent confidence gate, so the system keeps clarifying when the true job, outputs, exclusions, or standards are still fuzzy
- a silent-by-default GitHub benchmark scan plus reference synthesis that studies top public repositories and world-class pattern tracks, then surfaces only real conflicts or uncertainty to the user
- a generated visual HTML overview for each newly initialized skill
- a Review Studio 2.0 HTML gate page that combines intent, trigger, output eval, context, runtime, trust, atlas, adoption drift, reviewer waivers, reviewer annotations, release evidence, and per-warning fix actions
- a Skill OS 2.0 audit that maps each world-class requirement to current evidence, human-required gaps, and external-required gaps
- a Skill OS 2.0 blueprint coverage report that maps the upgrade plan's core modules and recommended PRs to concrete artifacts, commands, and tests
- a world-class evidence plan that turns remaining provider, human, native-permission, and real-client telemetry gaps into executable evidence tasks
- a world-class evidence ledger that records which external and human evidence is accepted or still pending without treating planned work as proof
- a world-class evidence intake contract that validates external and human evidence packets for provenance, privacy, artifact refs, and anti-overclaim rules before ledger review
- a redacted world-class preflight report that checks local files, environment readiness, human/external prerequisites, and source blockers before operators collect evidence
- a world-class submission review queue that compares evidence packets, intake validation, source artifacts, and ledger state without accepting evidence
- a world-class operator runbook that gives reviewers the exact commands, artifacts, and collection checklist needed to close remaining evidence gaps
- a world-class claim guard that scans public claim surfaces and blocks premature completed/true claims while the evidence ledger still has pending external or human evidence
- a benchmark reproducibility manifest that checks methodology sections, required artifacts, failure disclosure, and reproduction commands
- an evidence consistency gate that compares generated reports against each other so benchmark, overview, interpretation, adoption, world-class ledger, coverage, and Review Studio facts do not drift silently
- Output Eval Lab evidence with assertion grading, execution/timing/token evidence, a blind A/B review pack, a separate answer key, and reviewer adjudication reports
- a runtime permission probe report that checks packaged target adapters for explicit permission metadata, native-enforcement flags, metadata fallback notes, and residual risks
- a Python compatibility gate that catches supported-runtime syntax hazards before they reach GitHub Actions or packaged distribution
- a side-by-side HTML review studio for first-pass human review
- an artifact design profile that defines visual direction, layout patterns, and quality gates for reports, tutorials, dashboards, screenshots, and review pages
- a prompt quality profile that abstracts need modeling, RTF mapping, complexity, and quality checks into reviewer-visible evidence instead of bloating `SKILL.md`
- a systems-thinking model that maps boundaries, feedback loops, drift risks, recurring failure patterns, and highest-leverage quality moves
- three high-value next iteration directions after the first package is created
- a lightweight feedback log that does not require a full promotion cycle
- a local-first metadata-only adoption and drift report that turns real usage signals into next iteration candidates, with optional `yao.py` CLI run capture, external client event emit hooks, hook recipes, and JSONL import that record command names and outcomes without arguments or raw content
- an explicit-source adaptive proposal loop that summarizes redacted repeated user preferences and generates approval-gated adaptation proposals without scanning private logs or writing source files
- a SkillOps opportunity scorer and decision policy that ranks redacted repeated signals, maps them to report-only, AGENTS update, existing-skill patch, or eval-addition actions, and keeps every durable write approval-gated
- a weekly SkillOps curator report that aggregates daily opportunities, Skill Atlas portfolio signals, release lock state, and world-class evidence gaps into a proposal-only maintenance queue
- a Browser/Chrome Native Messaging telemetry host that can receive length-prefixed metadata-only client events and generate a local launcher plus manifest without storing raw content
- a Skill Atlas drift layer that reads aggregate adoption reports and surfaces portfolio-level drift signals without packaging raw telemetry logs
- a baseline compare report for with-skill vs baseline review
- a conversation-style, archetype-aware quickstart that steers new packages toward scaffold, production, library, or governed fits
- Skill IR as the platform-neutral semantic contract, plus compiler reports and client-specific adapters
- Registry audit metadata with package version, owner, license, checksum, and compatibility matrix
- governance, promotion, and portability checks built into the default flow

## Architecture

Hero view: Skill OS 2.0 turns messy operational input into a governed, reusable skill package through a model, compile, evaluate, release, and operate loop.

```

Read it in 10 seconds:

- **Inputs**: start from rough operational material instead of a polished spec.
- **Intent model**: make the job, outputs, exclusions, constraints, and standards explicit before generating files.
- **Skill IR**: keep the semantic contract separate from any single platform format.
- **Package and compile**: generate the lean skill package and the target-specific adapters from the same source model.
- **Evaluate and review**: turn trigger behavior, output quality, runtime checks, and trust signals into reviewable evidence.
- **Release and operate**: publish only within the current evidence boundary, then feed adoption drift and reviewer feedback into the next iteration.

## Weighted Quality Benchmark

This benchmark is a project-level engineering review, scored from `0-10` per dimension and weighted to `100`. GitHub stars are intentionally excluded because they measure ecosystem heat, not meta-skill engineering quality.

Weighted score formula: `sum(score / 10 * weight)`.

| Meta Skill | Method Depth 15 | Context Discipline 10 | Toolchain 15 | Eval/Test Rigor 20 | Governance 15 | Portability 10 | Onboarding/Review 5 | Local Reliability 10 | Weighted Score |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Yao Meta Skill | 9.5 | 8.0 | 9.5 | 9.5 | 9.5 | 9.0 | 6.5 | 9.5 | 91.5 |
| Anthropic Skill Creator | 9.0 | 6.5 | 8.5 | 7.5 | 4.0 | 5.0 | 7.5 | 5.0 | 67.5 |
| OpenAI Skill Creator | 8.5 | 9.5 | 5.0 | 2.0 | 3.0 | 4.0 | 8.5 | 4.0 | 50.5 |

| Rank | Meta Skill | Score | Core Positioning |
| ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| 1 | Yao Meta Skill | 91.5 | A complete engineering, evaluation, governance, and portability system for reusable skills. |
| 2 | Anthropic Skill Creator | 67.5 | Strong methodology and iteration loop, with weaker local execution reliability and governance coverage. |
| 3 | OpenAI Skill Creator | 50.5 | Best treated as a concise skill-writing method guide rather than a full engineering system. |

## Best-Fit Scenarios

- Choose **Yao Meta Skill** when the target is a reusable team asset with explicit boundaries, trigger evaluation, governance, packaging, portability, and local execution checks.
- Choose **Anthropic Skill Creator** when the target is a conversation-first creation loop and the priority is human-guided iteration over repository-level governance.
- Choose **OpenAI Skill Creator** when the target is a compact reference for writing lean skill instructions and keeping context small.
- A practical hybrid pattern is still useful: draft conversationally, then use `yao-meta-skill` to harden the package, add evidence, and make it team-ready.

## Quick Start

1. Describe the workflow, prompt set, or repeated task you want to turn into a skill.
2. Start with a short, human intent dialogue so the real job, outputs, exclusions, constraints, and standards are explicit.
3. Let `quickstart` clarify intent first, then run silent benchmark scan and reference synthesis; it only surfaces explicit questions when intent is still unclear or when there is a real design conflict.
4. Use the archetype-aware `quickstart` or the full authoring flow to generate or improve the package in scaffold, production, library, or governed mode.
5. Review the generated `reports/skill-interpretation.html` first for the bilingual interpretation report. It defaults to Simplified Chinese and provides an English switch in the top right. Then open `reports/skill-overview.html` for the audit scorecard and `reports/review-studio.html` to inspect release blockers, permission approvals, and evidence paths in one page before adding more structure.

Or use the unified authoring CLI:

```bash

## Local Development Source

Development source: this repository is the source of truth for authoring and review.

Use Python 3.11 or newer for local development. GitHub Actions runs the test suite on Python 3.11, and the Makefile checks the active interpreter before running `make test` or `make ci-test`.

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --requirement requirements-ci.txt
make ci-test
```

If `python3` points to an older system interpreter, pass the interpreter explicitly:

```bash
make PYTHON=python3.11 ci-test
```

Disabled mirror: `~/.agents/skills.disabled/yao-meta-skill` is the local backup mirror for this source. Keeping the mirror outside `~/.agents/skills` prevents Codex from showing a duplicate `Yao Meta Skill` while this repository is also visible in the active workspace.

Sync the current source into the disabled mirror:

```bash
make sync-local-install
```

The sync command first rebuilds the package and runs install preflight against `dist/yao-meta-skill.zip`. It refuses to sync when package extraction, adapter readability, or installer permission enforcement fails. After the preflight passes, it copies Git-tracked files plus new source files in code and guidance directories such as `scripts/`, `tests/`, `references/`, and `docs/`. It skips untracked business-skill folders and untracked private reports by default, so local experiments do not leak into the mirror.

Restore an active global Codex install only when you intentionally want this skill discoverable outside the development workspace:

```bash
make sync-active-install
```

That active install writes to `~/.agents/skills/yao-meta-skill` and can make Codex show a second `Yao Meta Skill` entry while this repository is open as a skills workspace.

## Generated Artifact Boundaries

Keep this repository focused on the meta-skill factory.

- Put reusable factory examples in `examples/`.
- Put reusable benchmark evidence, regression results, and release evidence in `reports/`.
- Keep private analysis reports, customer-specific outputs, and one-off generated business skills outside this repository unless they are intentionally promoted into an example or regression fixture.
- Place real generated skills as sibling skill directories under the local skill workspace, not as top-level folders inside `yao-meta-skill`.

## 5-Minute Workflow

1. Start from a raw workflow note.
2. Turn it into a skill package with `SKILL.md`, `agents/interface.yaml`, and only the folders the workflow actually needs.
3. Validate the trigger description with `evals/trigger_cases.json`.
4. Export compatibility artifacts for the clients you care about.
5. Compare the result against the examples in `examples/`.

Minimum commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/trigger_eval.py --description-file evals/improved_description.txt --cases evals/trigger_cases.json
python3 scripts/run_description_optimization_suite.py
python3 scripts/judge_blind_eval.py --description-file SKILL.md --cases evals/blind_holdout/trigger_cases.json --semantic-config evals/semantic_config.json
python3 scripts/context_sizer.py .
python3 scripts/resource_boundary_check.py .
python3 scripts/governance_check.py . --require-manifest
python3 scripts/compile_skill.py .
python3 scripts/cross_packager.py . --platform openai --platform claude --platform generic --platform vscode --expectations evals/packaging_expectations.json --zip
python3 scripts/probe_runtime_permissions.py . --package-dir dist
python3 tests/verify_packager_failures.py
```

Or run everything together:

```bash
make test
```

Unified authoring flow:

```bash
python3 scripts/yao.py init my-skill --description "Describe what the skill does."
python3 scripts/yao.py validate my-skill
python3 scripts/yao.py workspace-flow --target root --label first-pass
python3 scripts/yao.py review-viewer my-skill
python3 scripts/yao.py review --target root
python3 scripts/yao.py release-snapshot --target root --label release-candidate
python3 scripts/yao.py skill-ir . --output-json skill-ir/examples/yao-meta-skill.json
python3 scripts/yao.py compile-skill .
python3 scripts/yao.py package . --platform openai --platform claude --platform generic --platform vscode --output-dir dist --zip
python3 scripts/yao.py runtime-permissions . --package-dir dist
python3 scripts/yao.py package-verify . --package-dir dist --require-zip
python3 scripts/yao.py test
```

<!-- END:EVAL_RESULTS -->

- packaging validation: `openai`, `claude`, `generic`, and `vscode` targets pass contract checks and carry IR provenance, semantic parity metadata, and target-native behavior contracts
- target compiler validation: `openai`, `claude`, `generic`, Agent Skills compatible, and VS Code / Copilot contracts are compiled from Skill IR with generated-file mappings, adapter modes, native surfaces, permission enforcement notes, and unsupported-feature notes
- runtime permission probes: `openai`, `claude`, `generic`, and `vscode` adapters expose explicit permission contracts; current targets report `0` native-enforcement adapters and `4` metadata fallbacks with residual risks visible to reviewers

## Current Strengths

The latest weighted review puts Yao at `91.5/100`. The strongest dimensions are the ones that matter most when skills become long-lived team assets:

- **Method depth `9.5`**: formal skill engineering doctrine, archetypes, gate selection, non-skill decisions, lifecycle governance, and resource boundaries.
- **Toolchain completeness `9.5`**: authoring, validation, benchmark scan, description optimization, report generation, promotion checks, packaging, CI, and portability checks are wired into one operational flow.
- **Eval and test rigor `9.5`**: trigger quality is checked with train/dev/holdout, blind holdout, adversarial holdout, judge-backed blind eval, route confusion, drift history, and promotion gates.
- **Governance and lifecycle `9.5`**: important skills can carry owner, lifecycle state, review cadence, maturity score, trust boundaries, promotion decisions, and regression history.
- **Local execution reliability `9.5`**: the repository is executable locally through `make test`, `make ci-test`, and the unified `scripts/yao.py` authoring CLI.
- **Portability and distribution `9.0`**: neutral source metadata, client adapters, degradation rules, packaging contracts, and portability scoring preserve reusable semantics across target environments.
- **Systems stability**: generated skills now include a system model that turns boundary discipline, feedback loops, drift watch, and leverage-point analysis into reviewer-visible evidence.
- **Context discipline `8.0`**: the entrypoint is still held under budget, but this is tracked as a live constraint because the system now carries more reports, examples, benchmark assets, and generated evidence.
- **Onboarding and review experience `6.5`**: quickstart, HTML overview, side-by-side review viewer, and feedback logs have improved the first-run experience, but this remains the clearest UX improvement area.

The current direction is deliberate: keep the entrypoint light, make evaluation hard to fake, make governance visible, and continue reducing the friction of first-time creation and review.

## Why Yao

- **Lightweight**: the entrypoint stays compact, context budgets are explicit, and extra structure is added only when it pays for itself.
- **Rigorous**: trigger quality is checked with family regressions, blind holdout, adversarial holdout, route confusion, judge-backed blind eval, and promotion gates.
- **Governed**: important skills are treated as maintainable assets with lifecycle state, maturity expectations, ownership, and review cadence.
- **Portable**: source metadata stays neutral while adapters, degradation rules, and packaging contracts preserve reusable semantics across environments.

## What It Does

This project helps you create, refactor, evaluate, and package skills as durable capability bundles rather than one-off prompts.

The design logic is simple:

1. Capture the real recurring job behind the user's request.
2. Set a clean skill boundary so one package does one coherent job.
3. Optimize the trigger description before over-writing the body.
4. Keep the main skill file small and move details into references or scripts.
5. Add quality gates only when they pay for themselves.
6. Export compatibility artifacts only for the clients you actually need.

## Method Doctrine

The repository now treats method as a first-class asset instead of scattered guidance.

- [Skill Engineering Method](references/skill-engineering-method.md)
- [Intent Dialogue](references/intent-dialogue.md)
- [Reference Scan Strategy](references/reference-scan.md)
- [Pattern Extraction Doctrine](references/pattern-extraction-doctrine.md)
- [Output Quality Risk](references/output-quality-risk.md)
- [Authoring Discipline](references/authoring-discipline.md)
- [Skill Archetypes](references/skill-archetypes.md)
- [Gate Selection](references/gate-selection.md)
- [Iteration Philosophy](references/iteration-philosophy.md)
- [Non-Skill Decision Tree](references/non-skill-decision-tree.md)
- [Regression Cause Taxonomy](references/regression-cause-taxonomy.md)
- [Human Review Template](references/human-review-template.md)

## Why It Exists

Most teams keep valuable operating knowledge scattered across chats, personal prompts, oral habits, and undocumented workflows. This project converts that hidden process knowledge into:

- discoverable skill packages
- repeatable execution flows
- lower-context instructions
- reusable team assets
- compatibility-ready distributions

## Core Components

### `SKILL.md`

The main skill entrypoint. It defines the trigger surface, operating modes, compact workflow, and output contract.

### `agents/interface.yaml`

The neutral metadata source of truth. It stores display and compatibility metadata without locking the source tree to one vendor-specific path.

### `references/`

Long-form material that should not bloat the main skill file. This includes design rules, evaluation guidance, compatibility strategy, and quality rubrics.

### `scripts/`

Utility scripts that make the meta-skill operational:

- `optimize_description.py`: generates candidate descriptions, scores them on dev, visible holdout, blind holdout, and adversarial holdout suites, then reports calibration and family health
- `judge_blind_eval.py`: applies an independent rubric judge to blind-holdout prompts so blind acceptance is not backed only by the main threshold scorer
- `run_description_optimization_suite.py`: runs description optimization across the root skill and governed examples, then writes reusable reports and optional drift snapshots with calibration and family summaries

### `evals/`

Reusable trigger and packaging checks, including baseline and improved descriptions for comparison plus the root semantic configuration that drives description optimization.

This directory also contains route confusion fixtures and promotion policy rules for deciding when a route is promotable.

### `examples/`

End-to-end examples showing raw workflow input, design summary, final generated skill shape, and targeted description-optimization packs where route wording is tuned against example-specific dev and holdout cases.

### `.github/workflows/test.yml`

Continuous integration entrypoint that runs the full local regression suite on push and pull request.

## Validation Notes

- Trigger evaluation now uses a local semantic-intent model with explicit positive concepts, exclusion concepts, and boundary-case reporting.
- The sample trigger report now covers a larger positive, negative, and near-neighbor set rather than a tiny demo set.
- Train/dev/holdout trigger suites now separate iterative tuning from final verification.
- Description optimization now uses dev for ranking, visible holdout for non-regression, blind holdout for acceptance, and adversarial holdout for harder route-collision checks without feeding the ranking loop.
- Judge-backed blind eval now adds a rubric-based second opinion for blind prompts, so blind acceptance is not decided by one scorer alone.
- Description drift history now records adversarial calibration gaps and family coverage, so routing changes can be judged on confidence and family stability rather than raw error counts alone.
- Route confusion is now tracked explicitly across the root meta-skill, frontend review skill, governed incident skill, and `no_route` cases, so route theft is visible instead of implicit.
- Promotion policy now requires visible holdout, blind holdout, adversarial holdout, and route confusion to stay clean before a description should be considered promotable.
- Promotion checking now emits explicit decisions, candidate lifecycle states, iteration bundles, and human-review stubs rather than leaving promotion as a prose-only step.
- Promotion decisions now distinguish “no candidate beat current” from “current still has residual route risk,” so iteration can be audited without forcing every issue into a false block.
- Packaging validation now uses explicit contracts and YAML parsing, but it is still a lightweight local validation layer rather than a full platform integration suite.
- `evals/failure-cases.md` captures known weak spots that should remain part of regression checks.
- `failures/` captures reusable anti-pattern writeups and machine-runnable failure cases for routing, packaging, and authoring failures.
- `tests/verify_packager_failures.py` checks that invalid metadata, invalid YAML, and unsupported targets fail clearly.
- Governance metadata and resource-boundary rules now have runnable checks instead of staying as prose only.
- Governance checks now emit a maturity score so governed assets can be compared instead of only pass/fail checked.
- Description optimization drift history is now versioned separately from the main trigger regression history so routing improvements are visible over time.
- Iteration evidence now records why a candidate was kept, blocked, or promotable via a shared regression-cause taxonomy and bundle artifacts.
- Declared maturity tiers are checked against recommended minimum governance scores, so `production`, `library`, and `governed` assets can be compared without forcing every strong example into the same label.
- Context budgets are now tiered and explicit, so a governed skill can still choose a stricter `production`-sized initial-load budget.
- Resource-boundary checks now detect decorative directories and compute a local quality-density signal instead of only checking raw token counts.

### `templates/`

Starter templates for simple and more advanced skill packages.

## How To Use

### 1. Use the skill directly

Invoke `yao-meta-skill` when you want to:

- create a new skill
- improve an existing skill
- add evals to a skill
- convert a workflow into a reusable package
- prepare a skill for wider team adoption

### 2. Generate a new skill package

The typical flow is:

1. describe the workflow or capability
2. identify trigger phrases and outputs
3. choose scaffold, production, or library mode
4. generate the package
5. run the sizing and trigger checks if needed
6. export target-specific compatibility artifacts from the Skill IR contract

### 3. Export compatibility artifacts

Examples:

```bash
python3 scripts/export_skill_ir.py ./yao-meta-skill --output-json ./yao-meta-skill/reports/skill-ir.json
python3 scripts/compile_skill.py ./yao-meta-skill --target openai --target claude --target generic
python3 scripts/cross_packager.py ./yao-meta-skill --platform openai --platform claude --expectations evals/packaging_expectations.json --zip
python3 scripts/context_sizer.py ./yao-meta-skill
python3 scripts/resource_boundary_check.py ./yao-meta-skill
python3 scripts/governance_check.py ./yao-meta-skill --require-manifest
python3 scripts/trigger_eval.py --description-file evals/improved_description.txt --cases evals/trigger_cases.json --baseline-description-file evals/baseline_description.txt
```

## Advantages

- **Method-first, not prompt-first**: skill creation is treated as a formal engineering workflow with archetypes, gate selection, and non-skill decisions.
- **Trigger-aware by design**: descriptions are optimized with route confusion, blind holdout, adversarial families, and promotion policy instead of one-shot intuition.
- **Lightweight at the entrypoint**: `SKILL.md` stays compact while references, scripts, and evals are only added when they pay for themselves.
- **Toolchain-backed**: initialization, validation, optimization, reporting, packaging, and testing are available through one unified CLI and CI path.
- **Governed as an asset**: important skills can carry ownership, lifecycle state, maturity expectations, and review cadence.
- **Portable by default**: source metadata stays neutral while adapters and degradation rules preserve compatibility across target environments.
- **Evidence-rich**: route scorecards, regression history, context budgets, portability scores, and promotion decisions are published as artifacts instead of hidden implementation detail.

## Best Fit

This project is best for:

- agent builders
- internal tooling teams
- prompt engineers moving toward structured skills
- organizations building reusable skill libraries
